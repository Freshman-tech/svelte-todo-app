# Cypress Demo

We put together this repo to demo the [Cypress testing framework](https://www.cypress.io/) to our coworkers.

We were looking for a nice ToDo app to help show off how Cypress works, and found this [great Svelte app by Ayooluwa Isaiah](https://freshman.tech/svelte-todo/) which we forked as our starting point.
